Sure, here's a basic example of a Snake game in Python using the Pygame library. Make sure you have Pygame installed on your system.

```python
import pygame
import random

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Constants
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 400, 400
GRID_SIZE = 20
GRID_WIDTH = WIDTH // GRID_SIZE
GRID_HEIGHT = HEIGHT // GRID_SIZE
SNAKE_SPEED = 10

# Colors
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)

# Create the screen
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("Snake Game")

# Initialize Snake
snake = [(GRID_WIDTH // 2, GRID_HEIGHT // 2)]
snake_direction = (1, 0)

# Initialize Food
food = (random.randint(0, GRID_WIDTH - 1), random.randint(0, GRID_HEIGHT - 1))

# Game loop
running = True
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_UP and snake_direction != (0, 1):
                snake_direction = (0, -1)
            elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN and snake_direction != (0, -1):
                snake_direction = (0, 1)
            elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT and snake_direction != (1, 0):
                snake_direction = (-1, 0)
            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT and snake_direction != (-1, 0):
                snake_direction = (1, 0)

    # Move the snake
    new_head = (snake[0][0] + snake_direction[0], snake[0][1] + snake_direction[1])
    snake.insert(0, new_head)

    # Check for collision with food
    if snake[0] == food:
        food = (random.randint(0, GRID_WIDTH - 1), random.randint(0, GRID_HEIGHT - 1))
    else:
        snake.pop()

    # Check for collision with walls or itself
    if (
        snake[0][0] < 0
        or snake[0][0] >= GRID_WIDTH
        or snake[0][1] < 0
        or snake[0][1] >= GRID_HEIGHT
        or snake[0] in snake[1:]
    ):
        running = False

    # Draw everything
    screen.fill(BLACK)
    for segment in snake:
        pygame.draw.rect(
            screen, GREEN, (segment[0] * GRID_SIZE, segment[1] * GRID_SIZE, GRID_SIZE, GRID_SIZE)
        )
    pygame.draw.rect(
        screen, WHITE, (food[0] * GRID_SIZE, food[1] * GRID_SIZE, GRID_SIZE, GRID_SIZE)
    )
    pygame.display.flip()

    # Cap the frame rate
    clock.tick(SNAKE_SPEED)

# Quit the game
pygame.quit()
```

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Pygame. You can run this code, and the snake will move with the arrow keys, trying to eat the food. If it collides with the walls or itself, the game will end.
